         * Q1: Split Array
         * Send Feedback
         * Given an integer array A of size N, check if the input array can be divided in two groups G1 and G2 with following properties-
         * - Sum of both group elements are equal
         * - Group 1: All elements in the input, which are divisible by 5
         * - Group 2: All elements in the input, which are divisible by 3 (but not divisible by 5).
         * - Elements which are neither divisible by 5 nor by 3, can be put in either group G1 or G2 to satisfy the equal sum property.
         * Group 1 and Group 2 are allowed to be unordered and all the elements in the Array A must belong to only one of the groups.
         *
         *
         * Return true, if array can be split according to the above rules, else return false.
         * Note: You will get marks only if all the test cases are passed.
         * Input Format :
         * Line 1 : Integer N (size of array)
         * Line 2 : Array A elements (separated by space)
         * Output Format :
         * true or false
         * Constraints :
         * 1 <= N <= 50
         * Sample Input 1 :
         * 2
         * 1 2

         * Q2: Maximum Profit on App
         * Send Feedback
         * You have made a smartphone app and want to set its subscription price such that the profit earned is maximised. There are certain users who will subscribe to your app only if their budget is greater than or equal to your price.
         * You will be provided with a list of size N having budgets of subscribers and you need to return the maximum profit that you can earn.
         * Lets say you decide that price of your app is Rs. x and there are N number of subscribers. So maximum profit you can earn is :
         *  m * x
         * where m is total number of subscribers whose budget is greater than or equal to x.
         * Input format :
         * Line 1 : N (No. of subscribers)
         * Line 2 : Budget of subscribers (separated by space)
         * Output Format :
         *  Maximum profit
         * Constraints :
         * 1 <= N <= 10^6
         * 1 <=budget[i]<=9999
         * Sample Input 1 :
         * 4
         * 30 20 53 14
         * Sample Output 1 :
         * 60
         * Sample Output 1 Explanation :
         * Price of your app should be Rs. 20 or Rs. 30. For both prices, you can get the profit Rs. 60.
         * Sample Input 2 :
         * 5
         * 34 78 90 15 67
         * Sample Output 2 :
         * 201
         * Sample Output 2 Explanation :
         * Price of your app should be Rs. 67. You can get the profit Rs. 201 (i.e. 3 * 67).
